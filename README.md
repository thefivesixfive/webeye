# WebEye web scraper
## Download
The installer download can be found [here](https://github.com/thefivesixfive/webeye/tree/master/webeye-1.0.0/).
## Usage
Enter a URL you want to scrape and press Fetch Information. This presents all HTML tags in use on the site and attempts to find a `robots.txt` file. To scrape, click an element in bold on the right-side bar, click `Scrape`, and use `Next` and `Prev` to navigate between each appearance of the element.
## About
A simple webscraping app made in Python and PyQt. This was made when I was 12 so expect it to not be perfect; however, it is semi-functional. Despite this WebEye holds a special place in my heart as this was the first 'big' software project I ever completed
